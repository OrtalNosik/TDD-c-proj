## Features:

1. **Employee Data Management:**
   - Add 10,000 employees randomly.
   - Add a single employee by entering their information.

2. **Sorting by Salary:**
   - Implement sorting functionality with a runtime of O(n log(n)).
   - Explore alternative sorting algorithms with O(n^2) runtime, highlighting the performance difference.

3. **Tax Calculation:**
   - Calculate the tax for employees.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the project. Test cases are integral to the development process, ensuring robust functionality and code reliability.
